# 1 - Matrix river sizes ( Intermediate )

Problem statement: You are given a two-dimensional array of potentially unequal height and width. It contains only 0s and 1s. This array represents a map: 0s are land, and 1s are water. A "river" on this map consists of any number of contiguous, adjacent water squares, where "adjacent" means "above", "below", "to the left of", or "to the right of" (that is, diagonal squares are not adjacent). Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. Note that these sizes do not need to be in any particular order.

#Hint  
Algorithm to use: Depth-First Search

#Input example  
 matrix = [
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],  
[1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1],  
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0],  
];

#Output example  
[ 2, 1, 5, 2, 2 ]
